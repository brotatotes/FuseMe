    	<h2>What is FuseMe?</h2>
			<p id="about">
        Have you ever wondered what you would sound like if you were a synth or a robot? FuseMe can help you answer that question by fusing your speech with different sounds. The result will sound as if the noise (e.g. a synth) was saying what you are saying. Manipulating your voice can be very entertaining and lead to some odd, cool, or funny audio files (think SnapChat filters making people sound like bees or talking after inhaling helium). Our platform aims to make it simple to mess around with and fuse your voice with whatever sounds you like. We hope that you can get a good laugh or make some cool sound effects with our app to share with your friends.

      <h2>How does FuseMe work?</h2>
      <p id="how-it-works">
        FuseMe attempts to fuse the “sound effect” file and the “voice” file through a method called cross-synthesis. FuseMe starts by
        calculating short-term Fourier transforms of both audio files which gives the distributions of frequencies that make up the audio at different points in time for both files.
        It takes these frequency distributions and compute an envelope for every single distribution, capturing each distribution’s shape. Next, FuseMe
        divides frequency distributions of the sound effect file by their envelopes to flatten them.
        The flattened sound effect envelopes are multiplied by the corresponding voice envelopes.
        Thus, the frequencies throughout the sound effect are morphed to have a similar distribution as the frequencies throughout the voice. The result sounds like the sound effect is saying what the voice file says.

      <h2>How was FuseMe built?</h2>
      <p id="defining-success">
        FuseMe was built using python in Flask. Not surprisingly for a webapp, the front end uses HTML and CSS to display the pages. Key python libraries used are librosa, numpy, and scipy. Plots were generated with matplotlib. The Flask application is hosted on Heroku.

      <h2>How well does FuseMe work?</h2>
      <p id="results">
        Evaluating FuseMe’s performance is not as simple as one might expect. A very good fusion might be a combination of weird, interesting, or funny, all of which can be very subjective qualities. We decided to define a good fusion as one that maximizes the quality of the sound effect while maintaining intelligibility of the speech. We created and sent out a survey to our friends to help us learn about how well FuseMe performs with certain types of sound effects. We found that for a very sustained and consistent sound, like a note held on a synth, the resulting fusion was the most intelligible. However, for inconsistent or sporadic sounds, the fusions were not very intelligible.
